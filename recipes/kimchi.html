        <ul>
            <li>Cut the cabbage. Cut the cabbage lengthwise through the stem into quarters.</li>
            <li>Salt the cabbage. Place the cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with the salt. Using your hands, massage the salt into the cabbage until it starts to soften a bit. Let stand for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Rinse and drain the cabbage. Rinse the cabbage under cold water 3 times. Set aside to drain in a colander for 15 to 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Make the spice paste. Rinse and dry the bowl you used for salting. Add the garlic, ginger, sugar, and fish sauce, shrimp paste, or water and stir into a smooth paste. Stir in the gochugaru, using 1 tablespoon for mild and up to 5 tablespoons for spicy </li>
            <li>Combine the vegetables and spice paste. Gently squeeze any remaining water from the cabbage and add it to the spice paste. Add the radish and scallions.</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly. Using your hands, gently work the paste into the vegetables until they are thoroughly coated.</li>
            <li>Pack the kimchi into the jar. Pack the kimchi into a 1-quart jar. Press down on the kimchi until the brine (the liquid that comes out) rises to cover the vegetables, leaving at least 1 inch of space at the top.</li>
            <li>Let it ferment for 1 to 5 days. Place a bowl or plate under the jar to help catch any overflow.</li>
            <li>Check it daily and refrigerate when ready. Check the kimchi once a day, opening the jar and pressing down on the vegetables with a clean finger or spoon to keep them submerged under the brine</li>
